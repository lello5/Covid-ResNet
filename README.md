# GNR638 Project Report

## 1.Dataset preparation

The dataset we are using is COVIDx dataset. You need to follow this tutorial to
collect and prepare the dataset.

## 2.Preprocessing

```
a. Store the dataset in Project/Covid-19-Master/data
```
## 3.How to run the code?

## a. First, run preprocessing.ipynb to convert the image dataset

## to NumPy arrays. (Or you can directly download the .npy

## files from our work)

## Colab file( Preprocessing _colab)

```
b. Now either (if you have sufficient RAM) directly run GNR-Project.ipynb
Colab file ( GNR_projectcolab )
```
```
c. If you donâ€™t have enough RAM, run
i. CRL.ipynb
```
```
ii. Stage1.ipynb
Colab file ( STAGE1_colab )
```
```
